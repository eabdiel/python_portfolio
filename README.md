Some of my hobby Projects:

App0 is my jupyter notebook projects

App1 contains a project that interacts with a JSON file to provide english word definitions

App2 is a Folium project that generates a map out of a json dataset, and a list of volcanoes to create a fully working map with pins added to identify the volcano locations

App3 contains my robotic process automation projects

App4 is a tkinter UI for a bookstore application that interacts with an SQL database

App5 contains 2 programs to connect to file transfer servers one for FTP and another for sFTP

App6 is a CV2 application that calculates differences in frames to identify motion in a video feed - and creates a report with pandas dataframes to log the times something came into the frame

App7 is a realestate webscrapping app

App8 is an interactive data dashboard

App9 is a program that's meant to be used through the windows task bar search - you call the program and give it an address and it'll take the user to that address on google maps

App10 is my SAP Automation tools, mixed scripts using Win32API, Pyautogui and beautifulsoup/pandas.  There's also an interface and a report tool to track sap batch job failure

App11 is a modified craXel tool to remove password from MS Office files and macros
