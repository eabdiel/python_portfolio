Launch the launcher with the workbench_gui_launcher.py file.  

Qt.py is to control the QtPy5/PySlide/QtPy4 bindings see https://github.com/mottosso/Qt.py for details

the rest of the files are supporting files for the launcher. 

Note: Closing the file minimizes it to the system tray - to close simply close the program from the system tray or terminate it from our python terminal/IDE
